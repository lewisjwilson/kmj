# KimiNoJisho (kmj)

KimiNoJisho is the ultimate Japanese dictionary and custom flashcard app solution. With kmj, you can search for new Japanese words using Jisho's API. If you think the word will come in handy later on, just star it to add it to your list! Once your list is created, you can browse the words you added, or start a SRS flashcard game on your own personal Japanese list to improve your memorisation skills! This means you can improve your targeted areas of Japanese, rather than following generalised premade decks.


Features include:
- Your own personal list of words/dictionary
- A SRS Flashcard style game using your personal list
- Daily Flashcard Notifications
- Japanese word searching via the Jisho API
- Manual Entry in case of adding phrases or words not avaliable in the API. (e.g. slang words)
- An easy to use interface
